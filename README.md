### Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sara, I am a graduate student with a MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience and currently finishing a master in Data Science.

In the past I have worked at the [Center for Lifespan Psychology of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/research/research-centers/lifespan-psychology), where I analyzed brain imaging data and applied machine learning techniques (MVPA) to gain insights into neural processes. Now, I am shifting my focus to the intersection of data science and social science and am working at the [Center for Humans and Machines of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/chm), looking at how data can inform our understanding of social phenomena and machine behavior.

You can find some of my projects and contributions on my Github profile. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
